        <p>Fast and delicious egg for the whole family</p>
        <p>Easy to make and budget friendly</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Whis eggs with salt until completely combined and very foamy.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over low heat until bubbling. Add whisked eggs; cook, stirring
                frequently for even, moist curds, until thickened and creamy, but still shiny, 2 to 3
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Removed scrambled eggs from the pan before they begin to look dry, as they will
                continue to thicken off the heat.</li>
        </ol>
